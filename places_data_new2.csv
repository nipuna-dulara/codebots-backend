Ella/4.jpg",https://www.holidify.com/places/ella/,"Tucked into Badulla District, Ella is a charming laidback town drawing travelers to Sri Lanka's highlands with tea plantations, mountain jungles, and a cool climate. At an elevation of 1,041 meters, this wildlife-rich town has ancient caves, centuries-old secluded temples, and the famous Ella Gap - a cleft between two hills overlooking lofty views. Ella is just 200km from Colombo, and its central location makes it a great starting point for exploring Sri Lanka's beautiful hill side. The town is most famous for its iconic nine arches railway bridge which is a fine example of colonial-era construction in Sri Lanka. A trek down the railway track to the bridge is a popular activity, especially around the time the train arrives. There are numerous quaint cafes, walking trails and guest houses nestled in the hills for a peaceful getaway. One can also visit the famous Lipton's Seat where the tea mogul Sir Thomas Lipton would oversee his ever-expanding empire. Hiking to the breathtaking Ella Rock and Little Adam's Peak through bamboo forests is an incredible accomplishment. Sri Lanka's second-highest waterfall, Diyaluma Falls, overlooks natural swimming pools in Ella's mountains. Connoisseurs of the world-famous Ceylon tea love the plantations, tea factories, and Ella Spice Garden. Ella's other popular attractions are Ellawala Falls and Ravana Caves, where King Ravana hid Princess Sita and now offers 82-metre-high ziplining. So whether for a fun-filled vacation with friends and family, digging into Lanka's past, or beating the heat in style, Sri Lanka's ""Little England"", Ella features something special for every history buff, nature enthusiast, and hiker, trekker and the modern traveller.

Choose a hotel close to Ella Town Center for easy access to the best restaurants, cafes, and nightlife.

However, you need transportation like a tuk to visit places like Lipton's Seat and Diyamula Waterfalls. Negotiate the fare with tuk-tuk drivers before starting your journey Bike rentals are available at many shops and guesthouses Book the Ella Kandy train ticket in advance as the tickets get sold out fast","

Sigiriya/4.jpg",https://www.holidify.com/places/sigiriya/,"Sigiriya, often referred to as the ""Lion Rock,"" is an ancient rock fortress and UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the central Matale District of Sri Lanka. It is located between Dambulla and Habarane and is one of the most visited tourist destinations in Sri Lanka. Rising dramatically from the surrounding plains, Sigiriya is a colossal rock formation standing around 200 meters tall. Its sheer vertical walls and flattened summit once served as a fortified royal citadel. Sigiriya dates back to the 5th century AD when King Kashyapa chose this site as his capital and built a magnificent palace atop the rock. The fortress was abandoned after his death and transformed into a Buddhist monastery. There is a huge gateway shaped like a lion, and the place derives its name from this gateway. The rock fortress showcases the advanced engineering and architectural prowess of ancient Sri Lankan civilization. The remnants of the palace complex, including water gardens, frescoes, and the famous Lion Gate, depict the grandeur of its past. The highlight of the fortress is the colorful frescoes painted on the western face of the rock; it is believed that there were initially 500 such frescoes, but merely around 22 of them remain today. Another highlight is the Mirror Wall, a polished surface that once displayed reflective qualities and now bears ancient inscriptions and graffiti. The gigantic Lion’s Paws greet visitors before the summit. At the peak are the ruins of the royal palace of King Kashyapa I and 360-degree panoramas of the surrounding landscape. Sigiriya Museum at the foot of the rock has a plethora of artifacts related to Sigiriya on display for visitors seeking information regarding the site’s history. Ascending the rock involves climbing steep staircases and pathways, culminating in the Lion Platform. The rock fortress is surrounded by beautifully landscaped water gardens, reservoirs, and irrigation systems. Sigiriya stands as a testament to ancient Sri Lankan ingenuity and artistry, offering a captivating glimpse into the island's rich cultural heritage. It is a must-visit destination for history enthusiasts, archaeologists, and travelers seeking an unforgettable cultural experience.

Where to Stay: Central Kandy for restaurants and tourist attractions nearby. Anniewatta for a more peaceful area with stunning city views.

You can get around by tuk-tuk, which costs around LKR 50 for the first km, then around LKR 40 for every subsequent km. You can also hire a taxi.","

What was a faint old beach town has now risen to be one of the most popular surfing and whale-watching destinations in Sri Lanka. The beach town is situated 150 kms south of Colombo and is dotted with palm trees, blue waters, and colorful boats adorning the shores. The main draw of Mirissa is its pristine beaches. The soft golden sands stretch along the coastline, providing a perfect setting for sunbathing, leisurely strolls, and enjoying breathtaking sunsets. Mirissa has a beautiful view along with a million things to do over here – Whale watching, snorkeling, surfing, and bodyboarding. The city offers the right balance between calm days and lively nights by the beach. The bright and lively coast has happy hours for a part of the day and candle-lit seafood dinners once the sun sets. The clear waters, bundled with turtles and aquatic life, are a sight to behold. The local cuisine in Mirissa is a delight for food enthusiasts. From classic cocktail mixes to coconut-induced delights, burgers from the beach shacks to kootu, rice, and curry – Mirissa is a traveler’s paradise. A scooter ride away are the Weligama, Dalawella, and Unawatuna beaches, and if you’re lucky enough, you’ll see how stilt fishing in the shallow waters. The Parrot Rock, the iconic coconut island, Elephant Transit Home, and Galle Fort are some picturesque locations on this shoreline. Overall, Mirissa offers a perfect blend of relaxation, adventure, and natural beauty, making it an unmissable destination for travelers exploring the wonders of Sri Lanka's southern coast.

You can easily find a tuk-tuk, local bus or a taxi to reach Mirissa which is only 15-minutes away (local buses do not allow large luggage) In Mirissa you will be dropped off near the beach from where you can find a tuk tuk to your accommodation. Getting Around: Mirissa is small enough to explore on foot. In case your accommodation is a little farther, you can hire a tuk tuk. To explore nearby areas, buses and taxis are the best option. Where to Stay: Mirissa is small, so most of the accommodations are within walking distance of the beach. Whale Watching: The best time to watch whales is from November to March, when they migrate to Mirissa from the south. From May to October the tours are regularly cancelled because of the rains.

Unlike the country’s southern parts which are more influenced and in a way controlled by the Buddhist and the Sinhalese, the northern realms including Jaffna have a strong influence of the Tamil and the Hindu cultures. Historically, it was the centre of the LTTE power struggle to capture the city in 1995 which resulted in the devastating Battle of Jaffna. The city has been through a lot, but still today it flourishes as one of the industrial cities of the country of Sri Lanka. The town of Jaffna’s main revenues are from tourism and the port business. The city, due to being under the rule of various kingdoms and governments has several monuments for its visitors, each reciting a different yet alluring tale. Some of its monuments include the Jaffna Fort, the Jaffna public library, Jaffna Palace ruins, the Nallur Kandaswamy temple and much more.

Revered as one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Anuradhapura served as the capital of Sri Lanka for over a millennium, bearing witness to the rise and fall of several ancient kingdoms. It is known for its vast dagobas or brick stupas, ancient ponds and pools, and magnificent temples. Anuradhapura is not just historically important but also religiously significant, being a center of Buddhist pilgrimage and learning. The city's UNESCO World Heritage-listed Sacred City sprawls across an expansive area, offering visitors a captivating glimpse into ancient Sri Lanka's grandeur. Towering stupas, intricately carved monoliths, remnants of palaces, and colossal reservoirs speak volumes about the advanced civilization that thrived here centuries ago. At the heart of Anuradhapura's allure lies its spiritual significance. The city embraces the Sri Maha Bodhi, a revered fig tree believed to have sprouted from a cutting of the Bodhi tree in India, under which Lord Buddha attained enlightenment. This sacred tree, enclosed within a serene garden, draws pilgrims and tourists alike, fostering an atmosphere of tranquility and reverence. Authentic Buddhist traditions, archaeological ruins, lavish palaces, traditional monasteries, and informative museums define the grandeur of Anuradhapura. Even though it is a large town, Anuradhapura gives the feel of being in a village. With its well-preserved cultural sites, ponds, and monuments, Anuradhapura is a well-established tourist attraction in Sri Lanka. Tourists visit this town for a rejuvenating getaway, to seek peace, and to satiate their inquisitiveness.

Horton Plains National Park offers several hiking trails that cater to different fitness levels and interests.

Also called the sacred footprint, the Buddhists believe that it is the footprint of Lord Buddha, the Hindus as that of Shiva, the Muslims as Adam’s, and the Christians as that of St. Thomas the Apostle. After completing the ascent, pilgrims offer prayers at a shrine that sits atop the mountain. Apart from the legends surrounding the holy site, Adam’s Peak offers enchanting views of the sunrise. Any of the six trails, and a flight of more than 5000 steps, lead to the mountain peak. As one is reaching the summit, the steps gradually become steeper. Most visitors, irrespective of age and fitness levels, complete the hike in an average duration of two to four hours. An area of religious significance, a moderate challenge for enthusiastic hikers, and breathtaking scenery all around— Adam’s Peak is one of the must-see sights on a trip to Sri Lanka.

Unawatuna/0.jpg,https://www.holidify.com/places/unawatuna/,"When in Sri Lanka be sure to pay a visit to Unawatuna which is in the southern part of Sri Lanka, 6 km from Galle. Known for its beautiful beaches, hip cafes, trendy restaurants and plenty of sightseeing make Unawatuna an attraction for tourists as well as the locals who are looking for a weekend getaway. There are many different places which you may choose to stay at while at Unawatuna and there is something available for every budget. However, the main attraction of the place is the famous banana-shaped, golden beach. You can relax, unwind or have a relaxing time at the beach or take a dip in the cold water. The vibe of the place is quite similar to being in Thailand or Cambodia, and if you are fond of a happening nightlife, Unawatuna is the place to be. During the day you can have a chill time at the beach or indulge in some guilty pleasure by going on a shopping spree or pampering yourself in the delicious food of Sri Lanka. Make sure to visit the turquoise waters of the hidden Jungle Beach for a beautiful sunset. Unfortunately, the place has been rebuilt quickly after being affected by the devastating Tsunami in the year 2004, which might be a negative for some of the visitors. However, barring the negative side, there is still a lot to do and explore and make some beautiful memories at Unawatuna. Read More",4.4/5,Ideal duration:2 - 3 Days,Best Time:December - March,,"

Bundala National Park/0.jpg,https://www.holidify.com/places/bundala-national-park/,"Bundala National Park is situated off the Sri Lankan coast, around 12 km away from the port town of Hambantota. Harbouring 197 colourful species of birds each year, the park is an internationally eminent, UNESCO-listed wintering ground for migratory water birds in Sri Lanka. Bundala is undoubtedly the island nation’s best bird-watching region, home to the rare bird species of painted stork, purple heron and black-headed ibis. Over 50 migratory species, including the greater flamingo, arrive in large flocks during winter, making it a prime attraction for bird watchers, photographers and ornithologists. In 1969, Bundala National Park was acclaimed as a wildlife sanctuary and biosphere reserve. Ever since, it has been one of Sri Lanka’s most exciting places for jeep safaris, hiking and adventure tourism. Spanning 6,216 hectares, the park’s landscape is a spectacular tapestry of five brackish lagoons with salt pans in three verdant scrubs, marshes and sand dunes. The three most picturesque lagoons with a greater concentration of birds are the Bundala, Ambilikala and Malala lagoons. Ornithologists and nature aficionados can enjoy sighting waterfowls, grey herons, Indian cormorants, and painted storks. In the abundance of Hydrilla in Koholankala lagoon, the thriving species are the Eurasian spoonbill, openbill, small waders and coot. Bundala National Park’s beaches are breeding grounds for five endangered sea turtle species. Other animals like Sri Lankan elephants, langurs, grey-naped hares, civets, porcupines, monitor lizards, ruddy mongoose, golden jackals, macaque monkeys and crocodiles are also inhabitants of the park.

Located 160 km from Colombo, Matara has a stronghold in the teardrop island – in terms of scenic shores, Buddhist temples, a frolicking local life and authentic food. The name Matara translates to ""Great ferry"" which refers to the large seaport that facilitated immense volumes of trade. The Matara beach and the nearby Polhena beach is a humble abode for the local fisherman and traders. The Buddha temple Sunrise and sunset here are gorgeous sights that reflect simplicity and warmth. You can fly kites, play fun games and gobble some of the freshly cooked fish alongside the shore, and the beach is ever bubbling with life. The roads are immaculately designed to celebrate Dutch architecture. The old houses, churches and architecture stand as an ode to the past and ring antique vibes. The Matara Fort and Star fort dating back to 1560, Dutch reformed church of 1706, St. Mary's church of 1762, Old Nupe market of 1769 and Buddhist structures – Parey Dewa and Matariya Bodhiya, a sacred fig tree - are all sites of historical importance, architectural prowess and nature's elegance! An ideal tourist destination, Matara promises cosy stays, beach shacks, trips to the lighthouse (Dondra head), homebound pleasures like popsicles, tender coconuts and street music.

The national park is famous for its herds of elephants migrating for food, water and shelter, and forming a 'gathering' that can be witnessed by the visitors. The dry season is the best time to visit this place, as the majestic elephants migrate to the Minneriya Tank for water. Apart from elephants, the national park is also home to several mammals, birds, reptiles, and different kinds of plant species. Minneriya National Park comes under the dry zone, meaning, it receives less rainfall compared to the other areas in the country. The main attraction of this national park is the annual 'Gathering' of herds of elephants. During the dry season, these humongous creatures migrate from warmer to colder lands in search of water. This period is when visitors can book a safari and witness this grand event. Many species of birds and animals that are local to Sri Lanka are seen here. Remember to time your visit correctly, according to your desired attraction. You can book your stay at Sigiriya itself, so travelling to Minneriya gets easier. There are jeeps and guides available at the National Park, to help you roam around. Remember to wear comfortable clothes, and keep the National Park clean. The Minneriya National Park was first declared as a wildlife sanctuary in 1938. It was then designated as a National Park to conserve the flora and fauna that surrounded the Minneriya Tank. The Minneriya Tank is one of the most important historical elements of the national park. It was built by King Mahasena and derives water from the Amban River, and the Elahera Canal. Usually, during the dry season, animals migrate to Minneriya for water and food. Due to the various plant and animal species thriving in the national park, it has multiple habitats, ranging from wetlands to forests, to scrublands.

The temperature of the city remains refreshing and fresh throughout the year because of its hilly elevation from the rest of the towns and cities in the country. The town encompasses so many tea gardens and estates that one can walk in those tea gardens for several days without crossing the same paths twice. Other than the tea estates the town is known for the tea factories, Lipton’s seat and the Adisham Monastery, the trek to the waterfall, and also the trek to the Horton Plains are some of the other activities that the visitors can entertain. The town is a perfect amalgamation and the combo of flora, fauna, forests, cloud, hills and tea gardens that create the ideal environment for rejuvenating.

The unique relation of flora and fauna in this forest makes it one of the hotspots in the world. The forest is only 13 km in the stretch and around 7 to 8 km from north to south. The entire forest has remained untouched till date due to its inaccessibility. The ecosystem of this forest has been an essential part of it being termed as also a Biosphere Reserve. The species of animals and plants that are unique to Sinharaja Forest Reserve and preservation of other endangered animals and plants has given it a position of priority. Despite being highly inaccessible, it is not to say that human life is also not seen here. Villagers even live in unity with the forest in areas bordering this zone. Due to the density of the forest, not many animals and birds are seen as it is in other forest reserves and national parks, but it is home to a large number of animals and birds of various kinds. A visit to this rainforest is a definite must if you ever come to Sri Lanka. The serenity of this forest, the peaceful environment amidst the beauty of nature together culminates into a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

It is one of the few places in the world that holds religious significance for Buddhists, Hindus, and Muslims alike. The town's focal point is the Kataragama Temple , dedicated to the Hindu deity Skanda (or Murugan), who is revered as the god of war and victory. In addition to the Hindu shrine, the Kataragama Temple complex houses a Buddhist stupa, Kiri Vehera , which is believed to have been built by King Mahasena in the 3rd century BCE. This ancient stupa, surrounded by serene gardens, is a place of meditation and peace, attracting Buddhist devotees who come to pay their respects and seek blessings. Kataragama is situated along the banks of the Menik Ganga, a river believed to have purifying properties. Pilgrims often perform rituals and take ceremonial baths in its waters before proceeding to the temple. The surrounding jungle and Yala National Park are famous for nature walks and wildlife spotting, including elephants and leopards. With its ornate architecture and vibrant rituals, the Kataragama Temple draws pilgrims year-round, particularly during the annual Esala Perahera festival. This grand event, featuring traditional dances, fire-walking, and processions of elaborately decorated elephants, creates a captivating spectacle of devotion and celebration. Many devotees still stick to the practice of visiting Kataragama on foot. Read More",3.2/5,Ideal duration:1-2 Days,Best Time:December - March,,"

It is also known for serving as the start point of a trail that leads to the sacred Adam's Peak. A flourishing centre for gem trade for local and foreign traders alike, Ratnapura is home to numerous gem mines and a fascinating Gem Museum. Some of the world's most recognized gemstones, such as the Star of India, Blue Belle of Asia and The Star of Adam, were discovered at Ratnapura. The city's attractions are not limited to precious stones—Buddhist temples of historical significance and picturesque waterfalls are aplenty here. Maha Saman Devalaya is a shrine dedicated to the worship of Saman, the deity of Adam's Peak. Initially constructed in the 13th century, it was destroyed by the Portuguese three centuries later; the Sinhalese ruler King Rajasinghe II then rebuilt the shrine. Waterfalls at Ratnapura and the adjoining areas include Katugas Ella Falls, Bopath Ella Falls, and the little-known Mapalana Ella Falls. The city houses a National Museum, with artefacts reflecting the local culture and weaponry. Fossils of elephants, deer and other animals are on exhibit as well.

Best known for being the most popular location in Sri Lanka for white water rafting, a visit to Kitulgala is a terrific combination of nature and thrill. It is also one of the wettest places in Sri Lanka. The Kelani River which flows through the town served as a filming location for the Oscar-winning movie ‘The Bridge On the River Kwai’, released in 1957. Apart from being the base for white water rafting, Kitulgala has plenty of options for adventure sporting that sound too good to resist. These include jungle trekking, outdoor camping, mountain biking and waterfall abseiling. The natural attractions at Kitulgala are the most diverse, ranging from the Belilena Caves, where the 12,000-year-old remains of the prehistoric Balangoda Man (Homosapiens Balangodensis) were discovered, to the nearby picturesque Aberdeen Falls. Birdwatching is relatively common at Kitulgala, especially at the Makandawa Forest Reserve, owing to the myriad species of birds in the region. One can also see endemic bird species at Makandawa include the orange-billed babbler and chestnut-backed owlet and mammals such as the slender red loris. Whether you seek the adrenaline rush of adventure or solitude and tranquillity amid nature, Kitulgala is hands down the best of both worlds.

The warm sun enthrones the blue skies and sets a dewy glow upon the seas and the heaps of debris. Such is the scenic beauty of the Uppuveli beaches! The Koneshwaram temple or the Temple of the Thousand Pillars is a classical-medieval Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. Legend has it that this temple was built in 400 BC and it has devotees swarming in from different parts of the world. Fort Fredrick stands contrasting to the synagogue on the peninsula. The fortress which is now used by the Sri Lankan military was erected by the Portuguese and developed by the Dutch. On the same grounds, stands the Wellesley house, a real example of yesteryear architecture that once hosted the Duke of Wellington.

The town holds artefacts from the past and has historical icons which include three ancient stupas, old reservoirs and five major lakes including the Tissa Wewa. Paddy fields bound the northern part of the city. Car drives along the beautiful lake and countryside of Tissamaharama are spectacular. The sightseeing places in the historic town are aplenty including the Tissawewa and the Sithulpawwa rock temple, Tissa Dagoba, Yatala Wehera, Debarawewa clock tower and the Bundala birds paradise. Five major lakes in the locale of Tissamaharama are the Tissa Wewa; Yoda Wewa; Weerawila Wewa; Pannegamuwa Wewa; and Debarawewa Wewa. Thus 'Tissa' as the locals call it is a perfect marriage of nature and antiquity! Tissa falls under the classification of the 16 holy islands of Sri Lanka as it played a significant role in uplifting and enthroning Buddhism in the heart of its people.

Founded in 1954, the less visited but wonderfully unique national park shelters numerous fauna, including an impressive diversity of birdlife. The highlight of a visit to Gal Oya National Park is unquestionably the boat safari across the reservoir; soak in the scenery amidst the waters and spot plenty of wildlife. Spanning an area of 25,900 hectares, the fauna at Gal Oya National Park comprises 32 species of mammals such as Sri Lankan elephants, leopards and deer, and reptiles like star tortoises and mugger crocodiles. The elephant sightings are undoubtedly the best feature of the park. The birdlife at Gal Oya includes ibises, cormorants, egrets, eagles and more. The folk of the indigenous Veddha tribe also reside at Gal Oya; you might even be offered an opportunity to interact with them and obtain insights into their way of life and the park. The park has a few campsites for anyone looking to stay for a night amongst the wilderness. An unhurried exploration of Sri Lankan wildlife, coupled with beautiful vistas of the reservoir, make Gal Oya National Park a hidden gem among all of the wildlife hubs of the country.

This national park has the enviable distinction of being the oldest and the largest national park in the country. The park has earned its name from the numerous 'villus' (natural lakes in Sinhalese) that spread across the area. Wilpattu is known for its large population of leopards, among the highest in Sri Lanka. Apart from the leopards, one can spot a multitude of other mammals and reptiles at Wilpattu, such as the Sri Lankan elephant, sloth bear, spotted deer, Indian python and monitor lizards. The bird species at the national park includes Sri Lankan junglefowl, whistling teal and painted storks. Interestingly, the national park also has a specific historical significance.

Pasikuda/1.jpg",https://www.holidify.com/places/pasikuda/,"Pasikuda is a Sri Lankan resort town situated on the northeastern side of the country. Serviced by Batticaloa Airport, located around 34 Kms away, this quaint town is renowned for the stunning Pasikuda Beach with its sparkling blue waters. Pasikuda has a shallow coastline which is one of the longest in the world. One can wade for considerable distances into the ocean due to the reasonably weak currents here. In addition, the shorelines are rich in coastal reefs, offering visitors fantastic snorkelling opportunities. Although Pasikuda faced huge losses after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the Sri Lankan Civil War that ended in 2009, it has rapidly recovered its charm after extensive efforts by the Sri Lankan government and investors. Scuba-diving and snorkelling at Pasikuda Beach are very common; these activities allow tourists to see the coral communities up close. One can also try water sports such as windsurfing and waterskiing, or even an offbeat pastime like kite flying. Besides the beach, Pasikuda is close to attractions of historical and religious significance. The Mari Amman temple at Pasikuda is around seven centuries old and frequently visited by locals and tourists. Ancient cities, old forts and other structures sparsely dot the surrounding regions and make for good excursions outside the town for those who shy away from the shorelines.

Designated as a protected area in 1995, Lunugamvehera National Park is a wildlife corridor for elephants migrating between Yala and Udawalawe National Parks. Although not as famous as its neighbour, there is certainly no shortage of terrestrial, aquatic or avian residents at Lunugamvehera National Park. Some of the species here include elephants, leopards, spotted deer, tufted grey langurs and more. But the stunning birdlife is the cynosure of all eyes, partly due to the numerous aquatic species such as painted stork, black-headed ibis and spot-billed pelican at the adjoining Lunugamvehera reservoir. For an opportunity to explore the park at one’s leisure, visitors can also stay at a bungalow run by the Department of Wildlife Conservation, opposite a tank at the park’s premises. If you are looking for a birdwatching excursion away from the hustle and bustle of the famous national parks, or want to photograph the wildlife, Lunugamvehera National Park is undoubtedly your best bet.

A short-lived capital of the country in the 13th century, Yapahuwa was the site of preservation of the Sacred Tooth Relic of Lord Buddha. Fortifications and a moat surround the Yapahuwa Rock Fortress which limited the access to the city. A steep stairway that probably led to the Temple of the Tooth is the main attraction of this ancient city. The stairway is adorned with exquisite stone carvings; among them, the Yapahuwa Lion is the most popular and is reminiscent of the Chinese Lion. At the top of the staircase stands an imposing stone doorway, which opens into the now-empty temple. Some historians state that this was the site of the royal palace. For many years after the invasions, the caves at Yapahuwa were inhabited by Buddhist monks. The Yapahuwa Cave Temple houses remnants of Buddhist sculptures and murals. Also, inscriptions have been found at these caves. The Yapahuwa museum has numerous artefacts of the erstwhile capital on display, the most notable among them being an ornate stone window which decorated the top of the staircase. One can also observe Chinese coins here, evidence of the trade relations of the city with China. Read More",1.4/5,Ideal duration:1-2 days,Best Time:March-July,,"

Around 225 km from Colombo, the park is famous for its large number of Sri Lankan elephants, almost a whopping 150 in a herd! The discovery of evidence of ancient Sri Lankan kingdoms at Wasgamuwa, lead to the conclusion that the area was also an important battleground. Wasgamuwa National Park is home to many of the wildlife that was displaced during the Mahaweli Development programme in 1984; the project aimed to generate hydroelectric power and improve irrigation systems by utilization of the nearby Mahaweli River waters. The fauna at Wasgamuwa is a varied lot. The birdlife at Wasgamuwa is also reasonably abundant; the park has 140 species of birds, some of them endemic to the region. The fauna at the park also includes spotted deer, monitor lizards, mugger crocodiles and Sri Lankan frogmouth. Around 150 floral species have been identified here.

Senanayake (the first Prime Minister of Sri Lanka) established the Galoya scheme. Although this town is relatively small and with visits only via enroute, the town does house some worthy attractions. One of the most popular attractions in Ampara is the Kumana National Park; a fantastic place to visit, especially for wildlife enthusiasts. Covering an extensive area of 35,664 hectares approximately, this park houses a wide variety of birds, reptiles, and mammals. Some other well-known attractions are Deegavapi Stupa (an ancient Buddhist temple that is well-visited for its historical and religious significance) and Peace Pagoda (a peaceful temple built in 1988 to promote non-violence and world peace). So, while most people do not prioritise this town in their must-visit places in Sri Lanka, one should make some time for this budding tourist-town.

Kankesanthurai acted as the first naval hub in the country, which housed the first Navy Base in the country. Today, this hub has transformed into a family beach where views of visitors basking in the sun or swimming in the cool waters is a common sight. The name Kankesanthurai was inspired by the Sri Lankan god, Kankesan (Murugan). As this shrine was brought through the Gayathurai port, it was renamed as Kankesanthurai to honour him. Thurai in Sri Lankan means port. This picturesque village with a beautiful history has some of the best beaches in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. The main beach being the KKS and the other one being the Casuarina Beach, the beaches here are less-crowded, spotless, and untouched. Visitors coming to this part of the village indulge in long strolls, picnics by the beach and boat rides. Some of the other attractions along with the beach-side include Keerimalai Springs and Naval Port among others. Since it is a small village, the accommodation options are quite limited. All the attractions nestled in this area can be visited in a day. The best way to get to Kankesanthurai is via train, bus, or a private taxi, of which, the train ride is the most beautiful. Things to do in Kankesanthurai Kankesanthurai Beach: Recognized as one of the top two beaches and a family-oriented beach of the Northern Province in Sri Lanka, Kankesanthurai Beach is an unadulterated beach bracketed in pristine views. Visitors can relax under the palm trees, swim in the cool waters, or walk on the soft sand. Keerimalai Springs: The freshwater from the Keerimalai Springs is procured from beneath the ground. Many visitors, mainly Hindu pilgrims, visit to dip in this freshwater during the festivals - Aadi Amaavaasai and Maasi Magam. These rituals have been active for generations now and are generally carried out by men. Kankesanthurai Lighthouse: The Kankesanthurai Lighthouse is an octagonal-style tower, constructed in 1893. Situated beside the naval base, the lighthouse features a gallery and a lantern. This site is now severely damaged and inactive after the Sri Lankan Civil War.

The town features one of the most scenic beaches in Sri Lanka with its endless golden sands and the pristine turquoise waters. The northern edge of the cape boasts a curve-shaped Passekudah Beach with splendid white sands lined with luxury accommodations. Back in the days before the tsunami hit the Kalkudah Beach, the beach was dotted with plenty of tourist hotels and resorts. Since the tsunami, the beach has been deserted, mostly occupied by cows, dogs, and occasional fishers and boats.
